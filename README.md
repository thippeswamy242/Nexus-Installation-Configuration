# Nexus Repository Manager 2  â€“  System Requirements

## Supported Versions
Sonatype fully supports versions of Nexus Professional for one year after their release date. Older releases are supported on a best effort basis and the release dates of these versions are listed in our download archives1

## Host Operating System

Any Windows, Linux, or Macintosh operating system that can run a supported Java version will work. Other operating systems may work, but they are not tested by Sonatype.

The most widely used operating system for Nexus is Linux and therefore customers should consider it the best tested platform.

### Dedicated Operating System User Account

Unless you are testing the repository manager or running it only for personal use, a Nexus Repository Manager user account specific to the operating system is strongly recommended for running.
The Nexus Repository Manger process user is typically named nexus and must be able to create a valid shell.

***Note: As a security precaution, do not run Nexus as the root user.
